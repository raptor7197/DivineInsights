## Phases of Ethical Hacking
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
2. **Scanning**: Identifying open ports and services.
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.
4. **Maintaining Access**: Ensuring continued access to the target.
5. **Covering Tracks**: Hiding evidence of the attack.

## Common Tools
- **Nmap**: Network scanning tool.
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework.
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer.
- **John the Ripper**: Password cracking tool.
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any hacking activities.
- Follow the laws and regulations of your country.
- Respect privacy and confidentiality.

## Best Practices
- Stay updated with the latest security trends and vulnerabilities.
- Continuously improve your skills through practice and education.
